## Project Overview
- **Type:** Task Management Application
- **Name:** TaskMaster Pro
- **Framework:** React 19 (bootstrapped with Create React App)
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit (`@reduxjs/toolkit`), with persistent storage in Supabase database.
- **Backend:** Supabase for data storage and retrieval
- **Main Features:**
  - Add, edit, complete/incomplete, and delete task items
  - Multi-level priority system (Urgent, Higher, Normal, No Priority)
  - Sorting and grouping of tasks by various criteria
  - Trash/recycle bin system with soft delete and restore
  - Inline editing of tasks with priority selection
  - Task organization with grouping and sorting
  - Persistent tasks across reloads (via Supabase database)
  - Asynchronous operations with loading states
  - Error handling for database operations
  - UI styled with CSS (`App.css`)
  - FontAwesome icons for actions and priorities
- **Main Components:**
  - `App.js`: Root component, wraps app in Redux Provider and renders `ToDoWrapper`.
  - `ToDoWrapper.js`: Selects todos from Redux, renders the list, forms, and statistics.
  - `ToDoForm.js`: Form to add new tasks with priority selection and loading state.
  - `EditToDOForm.js`: Form to edit existing tasks with priority selection and loading state.
  - `Todo.js`: Displays a task item with priority indicator, complete, edit, and delete actions.
  - `components/SortingControls.js`: Controls for sorting and grouping tasks.
  - `components/TodoGroup.js`: Displays a group of tasks with a group header.
  - `components/DeleteConfirmModal.js`: Confirmation modal for task deletion.
  - `store/todoSlice.js`: Redux slice for todos, with async thunks, reducers, and sorting utilities.
  - `store/store.js`: Redux store configuration.
  - `supabase/client.js`: Supabase client configuration.
  - `supabase/todoApi.js`: API functions for interacting with Supabase.

## State Shape & Logic
- **Todos:** Each todo is an object: `{ id, task, completed, is_editing, priority, is_deleted, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at }`
- **Redux State:** Includes:
  - `todos` array: All active todos
  - `processedTodos`: Sorted and grouped todos based on user preferences
  - `deletedTodos`: Soft-deleted todos for trash view
  - `loading` status: For UI loading indicators
  - `error` information: For error display
  - `initialized`: Flag for first-load UX
  - `sortBy`: Current sort criteria (priority, dateCreated, dateModified, name)
  - `sortOrder`: Current sort direction (asc, desc)
  - `groupBy`: Current grouping criteria (none, priority, dateCreated, dateModified, name)
- **Redux Slice (`todoSlice.js`):**
  - Sorting and Grouping Utilities:
    - `sortTodos()`: Sorts and groups todos based on user preferences
  - Async Thunks:
    - `fetchTodos()`: Retrieves all todos from Supabase and applies sorting/grouping.
    - `addTodoAsync(todoData)`: Adds a new todo with priority, `completed: false`, `is_editing: false`.
    - `toggleCompleteAsync({id, completed})`: Toggles `completed` status.
    - `updateTodoAsync({id, task, priority})`: Updates the task text and priority, exits edit mode.
    - `softDeleteTodoAsync(id)`: Marks a todo as deleted with timestamp.
    - `restoreTodoAsync(id)`: Restores a soft-deleted todo.
    - `permanentlyDeleteTodoAsync(id)`: Permanently removes a todo.
    - `editTodoAsync(id)`: Sets `is_editing: true` for the specified todo.
  - Reducers for Sorting/Grouping:
    - `setSortBy`: Updates sort criteria and re-processes todos
    - `setSortOrder`: Updates sort direction and re-processes todos
    - `setGroupBy`: Updates grouping criteria and re-processes todos
    - `toggleSortOrder`: Toggles between ascending and descending
  - All operations interact with Supabase database via API functions in `todoApi.js`.
  - Handles loading states and errors for all async operations.

## Component Interactions
- **`App.js`** wraps the app with `<Provider store={store}>` and renders `ToDoWrapper`.
- **`ToDoWrapper.js`** uses `useSelector` to read todos, processedTodos, loading state, and error state, and renders:
  - App header with statistics (total tasks, completion percentage, urgent tasks)
  - Error banner when errors occur
  - Priority Dashboard showing counts of tasks by priority
  - `<ToDoForm />` for adding new tasks
  - `<SortingControls />` for managing sorting and grouping preferences
  - Loading indicator for operations
  - For grouped todos: renders `<TodoGroup />` components for each group
  - For non-grouped todos: renders a single `<TodoGroup />` with all tasks
- **`ToDoForm.js`**: Form with task input and priority selection; dispatches `addTodoAsync` with task and priority data; handles loading state.
- **`EditToDOForm.js`**: Form with task input and priority selection for editing; dispatches `updateTodoAsync` with task and priority data; includes cancel button; handles loading state.
- **`Todo.js`**: Shows task with priority indicator, task text, and action icons; dispatches respective async actions; shows `<DeleteConfirmModal />` when delete is clicked; handles loading state.
- **`SortingControls.js`**: Provides UI for selecting sort criteria, sort direction, and grouping options; dispatches sorting and grouping actions.
- **`TodoGroup.js`**: Renders a group of todos with a group header; for each todo: if `is_editing`, renders `<EditToDOForm task={todo} />`; else, `<Todo task={todo} />`.
- **`DeleteConfirmModal.js`**: Confirmation dialog for deletion; dispatches `softDeleteTodoAsync` when confirmed.

## Persistence & Backend
- Tasks are stored in a Supabase database table called 'todos'.
- The app uses environment variables for Supabase configuration:
  - `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL`: The URL of the Supabase project
  - `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: The anonymous key for API access
- API functions in `todoApi.js` handle all database operations, including:
  - Regular CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
  - Soft delete and restore operations
  - Priority management
  - Timestamp tracking (created_at, updated_at, deleted_at)
- Redux async thunks manage the asynchronous flow and state updates.
- The app implements optimistic UI updates for better user experience.
- Sorting and grouping are performed client-side after data is fetched.
